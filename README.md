### Un-fun stuff: grading & cheating
 ###### Cheating
 This class should be fun and collaborative.
   1. **Do not** directly copy designs or solutions from your classmates or the Interweb.
   2. **Always** cite your sources. If you did something cool, you'd want credit for it too.
  
 Still confused on cheating? It looks like [this](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/23/sports/YJPARMSTRONG1/YJPARMSTRONG1-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp)
