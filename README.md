### Objectives
  - [x] Understand the multi-faceted impact of infectious diseases
  - [x] Develop thorough research skills 
  - [x] Learn to develop solutions via design thinking 
  - [x] Fail with pride, reflect & move toward better solutions
### Tools
You'll learn how to use (or improve on existing skills with the following):
  - [x] Adobe Illustrator
  - [x] TinkerCAD
  - [x] arcGIS
### Projects & structure
The main focus is to create & present your unique solution.
You will have three types of assingments to help you get there:
  1. tools based
      - these assigments will be based off in class tutorials
  2. research & data collection 
      - you'll research and write about it (citing sources of course)
  3. writing & self reflection 
      - journal entries in OneNote

### Un-fun stuff: grading & cheating
 ###### Cheating
 This class should be fun and collaborative.
   1. **Do not** directly copy designs or solutions from your classmates or the Interweb.
   2. **Always** cite your sources. If you did something cool, you'd want credit for it too.
  
 Still confused on cheating? It looks like [this](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/23/sports/YJPARMSTRONG1/YJPARMSTRONG1-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp)
